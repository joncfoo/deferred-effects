# deferred-effects

1. Write your program as a set of instructions
2. Use only those instructions to build program
3. Interpret your program in multiple contexts

# Note

This package, for now, is entirely based on
[Operajonal](https://github.com/phipsgabler/operajonal).

The current goal of `deferred-effects` is to build on Operajonal with more
examples, documentation, and tests. Currently this is to satisy my curiosity - I
want to explore the UI space with the semantics of the Operational monad.
